Even though this ride was posted in 2019 the ride was done in 2018

**July 26-29, 2018**

**July 26 - Winnipeg to Fargo**

Excellent weather left Winnipeg on Thursday evening to ride to Fargo. Straight forward ride.

**July 27 - Fargo to Winona, MN** (pit stop in Minneapolis)

Excellent weather for the day. We took the I-94 from Fargo to Lakeville, MN (suburb of Minneapolis) 
directly to [Leo's South] (http://leossouth.com) where Joe's Aprilia will be serviced. The alternate dealers 
for Aprilia service are in Calgary or Montreal. Minneapolis is usually a more convenient location for us to get the service. 

We are both riding on the BMW from Lakeville, MN to Winona, MN. We picked up highway 52 south (south of Minneapolis/St. Paul) 
in the direction of Hampton. We turned east on highway 50/61 through Milesville. This was such a delightful ride with rolling 
hills between mostly corn fields with patches of soybean crops. The best memory was the strong sweet smell of corn as we 
drove down this road with the towering corn stalks on both sides of us. This was the first time I had experienced this smell.
This was one of the many times a smell memory is imbedded in my mind and the reason why I love riding my motorcycle.

Highway 61 takes us right into Red Wing, a town made famous by the manufacturing of Red Wing Shoes. This town also has a large
ceramics production facility that I didn't stop at but would be a must stop for one of my friends who is a clay crafter. 
At Red Wing highway 61 follows the Mississippi River and is called The Great River Road. This roadway starts at the 
Mississippi head waters, and runs through the states of Minnisota, Illinois, Missouri, Kentucky, Arkansa, Tennesse, Mississippi, 
and Alabama to finally drain into the Gulf of Mexico.
