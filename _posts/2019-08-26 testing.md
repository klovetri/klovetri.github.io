**August 2 - WINNIPEG, MB TO FARGO, ND (346 KM)**

This route is very very straight forward, Highway 75 South out of Winnipeg to the Manitoba-United States border (at Emerson), continue straight on I-29 through Grand Forks and then to Fargo.

When we left Winnipeg it was 31 degree C. 

I had my riding pants on (I wore very thin exercise crop pants under) with my flaps open as well as my riding jacket with all flaps open and a very light t-shirt. 
The only time that I got heated up was waiting at the Canada-United States border in Emerson. 
Fortunately, the wait was only about 10 minutes. 
We had a great riding day, sunny, clear, and no cross wind (yah whoo!!).
We made a quick gas and snack stop in Grand Forks and we saw a lot of cyclists either driving or hauling there bikes in the direction of [Sturgis](https://www.sturgismotorcyclerally.com/index.php?page=home), South Dakota as the yearly ritual had just begun.

**August 3rd - FARGO, ND TO ST. CLOUD, MN (417 KM)**
