August 2 - (346 KM)
We left Winnipeg on a hot 31oC. I had my riding pants on with my flaps open as well as my riding jacket with all flaps open and a very light t-shirt. The only time that I got heated up was waiting at the Canada-US border in Emerson. Fortunately the wait was only about 10 minutes. 
We had a great riding day, sunny, clear, and no cross wind (yeah whoo!!).
We made a quick gas and snack stop in Grand Forks and we saw a lot of cyclists either driving or hauling there bikes in the direction of Sturgis as it was starting August 3 in Sturgis, ND (https://www.sturgismotorcyclerally.com/index.php?page=home)
Good ride from winnipeg to fargo on Friday afternoon.
No cross wind and hot temp made for a great trip.
Aug 3rd left fargo and headed south on i94 towards minneapolis. Exited at the last exit (hwy 210) for Fergus falls to catch the otter trail mc ride (www.bestbikerides/Minnesota/ottertrail). We picked up the ride here and continued south to Dalton and around to near Perham and got on hwy 10. We took hwy 10 all the way to st. Cloud and spent the nite.
Aug 4th left st. Cloud and back tracked on the hwy  10 to Little Falls then took hwy 371 towards brainerd. Continued on the 371 to wise road (headed east) then he caught the 3 to the merrifield direction (this was a great curvy ride through here, will repeat again next time we are here). We took the 36 just before Crosslake and stayed on it until we came to hwy 6. Took hwy 6 north through deer river and to bigg falls ( road was great between deer river and big falls about half way up they had just resurfaced and the new road was still dark black. It was a bit eerie driving this as it seemed like we were the first ones using it. We met very few travelers on this section. We took the 71 north right into international falls  crossed into canada and stayed a the Bayview motel (highly recommend www.bayviewmotel.ca) in fort frances.
Aug 5 left ff on the number 11 hwy west to the 71 north. The 71  the road was a little rough for the first 20 km but got better. T the scenery and drive from just south of nestor falls all the way to the 17 is very scenic with lots places that one could stay. We headed into kenora for gas and lunch (liked the subway west side of kenora) as it has a great view of the city and water. Got home after 4 days of great riding.
comfort, but it may stifle the soul. Becoming a famous lawyer is only worthwhile if the soul demands it. It is an essential failure if you are called to be a monastic this time around. If you need to explore and abandon ten careers in order to stretch your soul toward its innate image, then so be it. Flake it till you make it.
