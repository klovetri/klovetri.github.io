**August 2 - WINNIPEG, MB TO FARGO, ND (346 KM)**

This route is very very straight forward, Highway 75 South out of Winnipeg to the Manitoba-United States border (at Emerson), continue straight on I-29 through Grand Forks and then to Fargo.

When we left Winnipeg it was 31 degree C. 

I had my riding pants on (I wore very thin exercise crop pants under) with my flaps open as well as my riding jacket with all flaps open and a very light t-shirt. 
The only time that I got heated up was waiting at the Canada-United States border in Emerson. 
Fortunately, the wait was only about 10 minutes. 
We had a great riding day, sunny, clear, and no cross wind (yah whoo!!).
We made a quick gas and snack stop in Grand Forks and we saw a lot of cyclists either driving or hauling there bikes in the direction of [Sturgis](https://www.sturgismotorcyclerally.com/index.php?page=home), South Dakota as the yearly ritual had just begun.

**August 3rd - FARGO, ND TO ST. CLOUD, MN (417 KM)**

When we left Fargo it was 26 degree C. 

I had my riding pants on with my flaps open as well as my riding jacket with all flaps open and a very light t-shirt. 

We left Fargo and headed south on the I-94 in the direction to Minneapolis. 
Exited at Hwy 210 which is the last exit for Fergus Falls, MN to catch the [Otter trail ride](www.bestbikerides/Minnesota/ottertrail). 
We picked up the ride from Hwy 210 and turned down Hwy 33 then to Hwy 35 to get to Dalton. This section of Hwy 33 has lots of curves and beautiful hilly terrain with very little traffic.
At Dalton take Hwy 12 to the end and make a right turn onto Hwy 78 then a left turn onto Hwy 38 and you will find the town of Urbank.
At Urbank turn left onto Hwy 59 then a left turn onto Hwy 40 which takes you back to Hwy 210 turn left (at this corner is an assortment of metal sculptures of big things at a gas station) and drive through the town of Vining (try to spot the big cloths pin and foot). Follow the 210 through Clitheral turn right onto Hwy 78 towards Battle Lake. Here we stopped at a beautiful lake side restaurant for a very hearty lunch at [Shoreline Restaurant & Lanes](http://www.shorelinebattlelake.com) (which was actually a breakfast plate, which is what the restaurant is known for) out on their patio. There tends to be some police presence in this little town but just watch your speed and you will stay clear of any trouble.

Here is beautiful Battle Lake from the Shoreline Restaurant deck.

We continued on Hwy 78 around Otter Tail and Rush Lake and turned right onto Hwy 10 just before Perham. Hwy 10 takes you through the small towns of Wadena, Staples, Little Falls then right into St. Cloud.

**August 4th - ST. CLOUD, MN TO FORT FRANCES, ON (405 KM)**

When we left St. Cloud it was 28 degree C. 

I had my riding pants (just underwear and my riding pants, not much difference with the heat but think I prefer the feel of my exercise pants versus my riding pants alone, personal preference only) on with my flaps open as well as my riding jacket with all flaps open and a very light t-shirt. 

We backtracked from St. Cloud North on Hwy 10 to Little Falls then proceeded on Hwy 371 towards Brainerd and Baxter to just past the Three Bear Water Park and turned right onto Wise Road and follow this until it ends at Hwy 3. Turn left onto Hwy 3 to get to Merrifield you will past Lake Edward and Pelican Lake. Oh my gosh what a great ride through many twisties and cottages with very little traffic. This piece of road is one we will come back to on a follow up trip hopefully soon. We took Hwy 36 just before Crosslake and stayed on it until we came to Hwy 6. Next time we will try to follow up through Crosslake and meet the Hwy 6 further North just to see if there were more twisties to experience. We then took Hwy 6 north to Deer River. Note there is a short cut Hwy 11 (sign saying short cut to Deer River) from Hwy 6 which maybe a little more scenic than staying on the 6 (we will try next time) then to Big Falls (road was great between Deer River and Big Falls) about half way up it was in the final stages of being resurfaced and the new road was still dark black. It was a bit eerie driving this as it seemed like we were the first ones using it. We met very few travelers on this section. At Big Falls we turned right onto Hwy 71 which takes you into International Falls. We picked up our duty free then paid the $2.00/motorcycle (they took Canadian cash at par) to cross what seemed like just a floating dock for a bridge into the town of Fort Frances. We stayed at the [Bayview Motel](www.bayviewmotel.ca), we would high recommend this spot as right across the road from the hotel is a beautiful path that runs along the shores of Rainy River Bay as well they had a dock with a roped off swim area which was so welcomed after another long day of hot weather riding. We enjoyed breakfast at the [Harborage](https://www.facebook.com/theharbouragerestaurant/?rf=231172103575044) which was very good and well priced. There are more food places on the west side of Fort Frances on Hwy 11.

**August 5th - FORT FRANCES, ON TO WINNIPEG, MB (426 KM)**

When we left Fort Frances it was 17 degree C. 

I had my riding pants on with my flaps open as well as my riding jacket with all flaps open except for my sleeve flaps which I closed and was comfortable with and a very light t-shirt under my jacket for the full day of riding. 

Heading West on Hwy 11 out of Fort Frances through the town of Emo and made a right turn onto Hwy 71 north. The initial 20 km of Hwy 71 was a little rough (probably from heavy semi-truck traffic) but it did improve. The scenery and drive on Hwy 71 from Caliper Lake all the way to Hwy 17 is very scenic with lots of places that one could stay. There were numerous twisties in this area and a few road side scenic stops one can take advantage of for a short rest. If you can find a place to stay this would be a great 2 day trip from Winnipeg to Nestor Falls (337 KM one way) and back. 
We headed into Kenora for gas and lunch,we liked the subway on the west side of Kenora, as it has a great view of the city and water. Beware Hwy 17 from Kenora until just past Falcon Lake, MB is an extremely busy 1 way highway with numerous tractor trailers and is know as a dangerous roadway especially if it is a Sunday or Monday of a long weekend when numerous cottage goers are returning back to Winnipeg. We arrived back home after 4 days of great riding.
