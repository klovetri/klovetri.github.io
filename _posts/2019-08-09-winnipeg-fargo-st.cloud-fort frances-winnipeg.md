August 2 - (346 KM)

The route is very very straight forward, Highway 75 South out of Winnipeg to Border (Emerson), continue straight of I-29 through Grand Forks and then to Fargo.

When we left Winnipeg it was 31 degree C. 

I had my riding pants on with my flaps open as well as my riding jacket with all flaps open and a very light t-shirt. 
The only time that I got heated up was waiting at the Canada-US border in Emerson. 
Fortunately the wait was only about 10 minutes. 
We had a great riding day, sunny, clear, and no cross wind (yah whoo!!).
We made a quick gas and snack stop in Grand Forks and we saw a lot of cyclists either driving or hauling there bikes in the direction of [Sturgis](https://www.sturgismotorcyclerally.com/index.php?page=home), South Dakota as the yearly ritual had just started.

August 3rd - (417 KM)

We left Fargo and headed south on the I-94 in the direction to Minneapolis. 
Exited at Hwy 210 which is the last exit for Fergus Falls, MN to catch the [Otter trail ride](www.bestbikerides/Minnesota/ottertrail). 
We picked up the ride from Hwy 210 and turned down Hwy 33 then to Hwy 35 to get to Dalton. This section of Hwy 33 has lots of curves and beautiful hilly terrain with very little traffic.
At Dalton take Hwy 12 to the end and make a right turn onto Hwy 78 then a left turn onto Hwy 38 and you will find the town of Urbank.
At Urbank turn left onto Hwy 59 then a left turn onto Hwy 40 which takes you back to Hwy 210 turn left (at this corner is an assortment of metal sculptures of big things at a gas station) and drive through the town of Vining (try to spot the big cloths pin and foot). Follow the 210 through Clitheral turn right onto Hwy 78 towards Battle Lake. Here we stopped at a beautiful lake side restaurant for a very hearty lunch at [Shoreline Restaurant & Lanes] (http://www.shorelinebattlelake.com) (which was actually a breakfast plate, this is what they are famous for) out on their patio. There tends to be some police presence in this little town but just watch your speed and you will stay clear of any trouble.
We continued on Hwy 78 around Otter Tail and Rush Lake and turned right onto Hwy 10 just before Perham. Hwy 10 takes you through the small towns of Wadena, Staples, Little Falls then right into St. Cloud.

August 4th - (405 KM)

left st. Cloud and back tracked on the hwy  10 to Little Falls then took hwy 371 towards brainerd. Continued on the 371 to wise road (headed east) then he caught the 3 to the merrifield direction (this was a great curvy ride through here, will repeat again next time we are here). We took the 36 just before Crosslake and stayed on it until we came to hwy 6. Took hwy 6 north through deer river and to bigg falls ( road was great between deer river and big falls about half way up they had just resurfaced and the new road was still dark black. It was a bit eerie driving this as it seemed like we were the first ones using it. We met very few travelers on this section. We took the 71 north right into international falls  crossed into canada and stayed a the [Bayview Motel] (www.bayviewmotel.ca),highly recommend in Fort Frances.

Aug 5 left ff on the number 11 hwy west to the 71 north. The 71  the road was a little rough for the first 20 km but got better. T the scenery and drive from just south of nestor falls all the way to the 17 is very scenic with lots places that one could stay. We headed into kenora for gas and lunch (liked the subway west side of kenora) as it has a great view of the city and water. Got home after 4 days of great riding.
