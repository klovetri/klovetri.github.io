**August 30- WINNIPEG TO CROOKSTON, MN (250 KM)**

We left Winnipeg in the late afternoon since the destination was only 250 km away, we choose to take historic [hwy75] (https://scenicbyways.info/search.html?q=hwy+75) which in the United States is designated as one of their Scenic Route Highways at a length of over 1200 km running from the northern state of Minnesota to Texas. This will no doubt be a future destination for riding. From Winnipeg to the Canada-USA border it is our well used path to get to the USA. The temperature was about 21 degrees C. with only a light wind. Once over the border you exit at Pembina and take the second left onto hwy 59/75. This is a 2 way highway but has very low traffic. It is definately pleasant riding through miles of farm land. At this time there are numerous farmers working to take there cash crops of wheat, corn and sugar beets. Along the way you pass through some very small towns,
