**August 30 - September 2, 2019**

**August 30- WINNIPEG TO CROOKSTON, MN (250 KM)**

The temperature was about 21 degrees C, I had my riding gear on with all flaps closed and would not have minded wearing my rain liner. I hate that feeling of summer heat fading away. The wind was light.

We left Winnipeg in the late afternoon since the destination was only 250 km away, we choose to take historic Highway 75 which in the United States is designated as one of their Scenic Route Highways at a length of over 1200 km running from the northern state of Minnesota to Texas. This will no doubt be a route we will mark for future riding. From Winnipeg to the Canada-USA border it is our well worn path south on Hwy 75 (the Canadian segment of this historic highway) to the Emerson border crossing. 

Once over the border you exit at Pembina and head east over the overpass then take the second left heading North onto Hwy 59/75. This is a two way highway but has very low traffic. It is definately pleasant riding through miles of farm land. At this time of year there were numerous farmers working to get there cash crops of wheat, corn and sugar beets off the land and into the numerous grain bins or in long plastic bags on the ground. This really is an overwhelming sight to see, how much product is grown and how many lives depend on this for sustenance (both food and income). 

Along the way you pass through some very small towns (Hallock, Donaldson, Argyle, Warren, Euclid). We made a gas stop in Argyle and just across the road was The Dell Steakhouse & Lounge which looked like the happening spot in town on a Friday night. I checked it out on TripAdvisor and it had 1 very good review. If you are the neighborhood check it out and let us know if it lives up to its appearance and 1 review!!

Once in Crookston we unloaded and freshed up. It was time to look for an upbeat place to get ourselves some sustanance. Not too far down the road was [Draft Sports Bar](https://www.draftssportsbar.com), the hotel attendent recommended it to us. Once we arrived we sought out some of the local beers. I had a taste of a fine wheat beer made in Hallock at [Revelation Ale Works](www.revales.com) called Edison's Medicine NE IPA. Joe got a chance to sample 2 of the [Burning Brothers](https://www.burnbrosbrew.com) gluten free beers; the pyro and Most Coast, he preferred the Most Coast. If you have a math background you will get the symbols on the beer can.

Check out their website they are a gluten free facility, and if you are in the St. Paul, MN area please drop in for a visit. We will definately dropping in the next time we are in the area.

**August 31 - CROOKSTON TO BAXTER, MN (342 KM)**

We started the day with an easy jog around the northeast area of Crookston before we started riding. It was about 18 degrees C. when we got packed up and ready for our day of riding to Baxter. We headed East on Highway 2 to Highway 59. South on highway 59 to highway 113 at Waubun we went east towards Itasca State Park. I was so anxious to get on highway 113 (I had read that it was a great ride) that I opted not to stop at the Ez-1 Stop at the corner of Hwy 59 and 113. Mistake!! we had ridden already 1 hour and we really needed to get a warm drink and a rest since there was no other gas station on the highway 113. We did stop at the Tulaby Lake lookout/boat launch. Thank goodness I had packed some cookies and some pop to tie us over. The lookout had a nice view and a portapottie. After a rest we continued our ride to Highway 71. We went south on the 71 to Park Rapids. We stopped in Park Rapids at the A&W for lunch. this A&W was a real blast in the past. It still had the drive in with the microphone and the waitress will deliver your order to your car window. I know I am dating myself but it was really cool to have the service and memories of days gone by. Also US A&W do not have a teenburger, this is a Canadian burger!!.
Back on the bike continuing south on Highway 71 to Highway 87 turning left (east). Ride to Highway 64 and turn right (south) which turns back to the 87 through Backus to Highway 371. This stretch of road takes you around the south point of Long Lake through Badoura State and Foot Hills State Forests. These are two way highways but not heavily traveled so the riding was delightful. At the 371 we went North to get back on Highway 87 (right turn, east) to Highway 84 (right turn, south) that brought us to Pine River and back to Highway 371. We took the 371 south to Baxter. Highway 371 is a major throughfare and is very busy as it services a lot of the tourist areas in this part of Minnesota. I would recommend taking the roads less travelled in this part of Minnesota, the roads are paved and not busy and offers some very nice scenery, twisties and generally great riding.

**September 1 - BAXTER TO FARGO, ND (379 KM)**

Today was a cloudy dark day which lasted the full day but we did not get any rain, the temperature didn't get any higher than 17 degrees C. The hotel attendant seeing we were on motorcycles suggested the route around Gull Lake was a very popular ride. We took her advice and left Baxter heading north on Highway 371 turning left onto Pine Beach Road/County Hwy 77SW/Interlacken Road all the way around Gull Lake. This was a scenic drive.

From here we continued on County Road 13 to Lake Hubert to County Road 4 North to county Road 118N to Ross Point road then onto Pelican Lake Rd to Pelican Lane to Hwy 3. Hwy 3 North to Cross Lake, keep following Hwy 3 up to Hwy 1 going east to the town of Emily. Once at Emily we headed North on Hwy 6 through towns of Outing and up to Remer. this route was very busy with the quads having a well work trail in the ditches and they would gather at the towns of Outing and Remer where they would gather in groups of 15 to 25 quads. They looked like they were having a great time.

At Remer we took Hwy 200 in the direction of Walker. We have been to Walker on 2 previous rides. We always enjoy stopping in this little picturesque town. If you are in the area stop at the lake front park and take a walk to the small lighthouse. At Walker we took Hwy 34 through the towns of Akeley, Nevis, Park Rapids, Osage, Detroit Lakes and then to Fargo. We decided to take Hwy 10 from Detroit Lakes right through to Fargo. This was not the best route to take good thing the temperature was not hot as there was a lot of stop and go. It was the first time we saw this part of Fargo.

**September 2 - FARGO - WINNIPEG**

We made our regular stop in Fargo, visiting Wild Bills Sports Saloon, Happy Harry's and Kohl's and made our way back to Winnipeg. We were happy we got to ride the weekend with out any rain. Well I bid a farewell to the last long trip on 2019 but have a few ideas for the 2020 riding season and where it may take us. 

Destinations dreaming of for 2020: Alaska, Canadian East Coast, Mount Rushmore, West Shore of Lake Superior between Thunder Bay and Duluth and I have just run out of holidays!!

Happy riding into the fall!

Over the winter I will be posting some of the past rides that I have taken. I usually put a first sentence stating when I did the ride .
