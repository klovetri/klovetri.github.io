Even though this is dated 2019 which is when I physically added this to my website, in time I am describing events that happened in October of 2017. 

If you have read My history you will see that I wanted to get back behind the bars driving my own motorcycle. After a bit of casual looking at various makes of bikes (Suzuki, Kawasaki, Honda, MotoGuzzi, Yamaha, Ducati, Triump and BMW).

I am trying this pull request to see if I can bring this file into my page.
