**October 5, 2017**


If you have read the "About Me" section you will have read that I wanted to get back behind the bars driving my own motorcycle. After a bit of casual looking at various makes of new bikes (Suzuki, Kawasaki, Honda, MotoGuzzi, Yamaha, Ducati, Triump and BMW) during the summer of 2017. I knew some basics, I am 5 foot 7 inches and am shrinking with time. I am pretty strong but I didn't want a bike that was too heavy. I wanted to be able to pick it up after a drop without breaking my back. I didn't want to spend a ton of cash and I wanted something new or barely used. I knew I wanted a touring style of bike not a cruiser. Other than these points I really wasn't that picky. The big thing is **I** wanted to feel the bike was under my control and not vice versa. 

My husband (Joe) really was the lead on the search as I am the type that really doesn't like to spend money on myself. I can spend a fortune on others without batting an eye (so easy).  Joe was doing a lot of looking and comparing and happened on [kijiji](www.kijiji.com) and found the slightly used BMW F700GS for sale in Mississauga, Ontario. The bike came fully equipped with side and top bags, windshield, safety lights and even a folding trailer. After a phone call and some money transfers we set off with the license plates in hand. We travelled from Winnipeg to Ontario through the United States and came back through Canada to avoid any issues of transporting the new purchase through the United States.
