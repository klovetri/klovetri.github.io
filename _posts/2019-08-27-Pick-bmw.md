If you have read the About Me section you will have read that I wanted to get back behind the bars driving my own motorcycle. After a bit of casual looking at various makes of new bikes (Suzuki, Kawasaki, Honda, MotoGuzzi, Yamaha, Ducati, Triump and BMW) during the summer of 2017.

My husband was looking on kijiji and found the slightly used BMW F700GS for sale in Mississauga, Ontario. The bike came fully equiped with side and top bags, windshield, safety lights and even a folding trailer. After a phone call and some money transfers we set off with the license plates in hand. We travelled from Winnipeg to Ontario through the United States and came back through Canada to avoid any issues of transporting the new purchase through the United States.
