**April 19, 2018** 

It is now spring and the longer days are allowing for short, leisurely daily rides near home after a work day. This is just one of those rides. This particular route is one of our favorites as we get to see both sides of the Red River. 

Leaving from the south perimeter at Pembina Highway we circle around Winnipeg all along the perimeter and exit at North Henderson Highway. This stretch of Henderson Highway is well used and boasts alot of large estate type homes and numerous garden stands and depending on the day garage sales and vehicles for sale. Some of the places to to find some good eats near and in the town of Lockport (e.g. A&W, Subway, [Half Moon](https://www.halfmoondrivein.com), [Skinners](https://www.skinners.ca),[Pappa Carlo Pizzeria & Gelati](www.papacarlopizzeria.ca),[Gaffer's Restaurant & Lounge](https://gaffers.net) to name a few). 
On the east sude of the locks is [Lockport Heritage Park](https://www.travelmanitoba.com) a great place to stop and catch the view of the pelicans and the fisherman testing their fishing skills.

The locks is a very tall iron bridge with good views either north or south as you are driving over. Careful it can be quite windy at the top. After the bridge take the first left then and at the STOP sign take another left which will bring you to Red River Drive and make a right. You are now driving on the west side of the Red River. On this side you will see [Captain Kennedy House](https://www.mhs.mb.ca)with a rest stop near by. Many years ago they were running a pleasant cafe at the back of the house. Unfortunately, it no longer exists since the building is in need of extensive repairs which have been long [overdue](https://wwwredrivernorthtourism.com). There is a political issue around this which may be of interest. There is another rest stop further down and if you fancy golf there is a plesant course [Larters](https://www.larters.com) just before hitting the highway. Red River Drive will lead you back to highway 9, head south until you hit the perimeter.
