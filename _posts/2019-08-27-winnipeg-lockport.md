This was posted in 2019 but the ride was in **2018**

**April 19, 2018** 

It is now spring and the longer days are allowing for short, leisurely daily rides near home after a work day. This is just one of those rides. This particular route is one of our favorites as we get to see both sides of the Red River. 

Leaving from the south perimeter at Pembina Highway we circle around and go north on Henderson Highway to the town of Lockport where we have a bite one of the many places (e.g. A&W, Half Moon, Gaffer's to name a few). If you want it is a nice stop on the north side of the locks and you can view the pelicans and the fisherman testing their fishing skills.

Once you have had your stop with a bite or not you drive over the bridge. Careful it can be quite windy at the top. You can head south on Red River Drive back to the perimeter driving on the west side of the Red River. On this side you will see Captain Corelli's house with a rest stop near by. Many years ago they were running a pleasant cafe at the back of the house. Unfortunately, it no longer exists. There is another rest stop further down then you will see the golf course before hitting the highway. Take highway 9 south to the perimeter and retrace your steps back.
