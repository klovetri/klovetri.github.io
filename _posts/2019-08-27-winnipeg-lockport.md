This was posted in 2019 but the ride was in **2018**

**April 19, 2018** 

It is now spring and the longer days are allowing for short, leisurely daily rides near home after a work day. This is just one of those rides. This particular route is one of our favorites as we get to see both sides of the Red River. 

Leaving from the south perimeter at Pembina Highway we circle around and go north on Henderson Highway to the town of Lockport where we sometimes stop for some food at a variety of locations (e.g. A&W, Half Moon, Gaffer's to name a few). 
There is also a gravel parking lot on either side of the locks where you can stop and catch the view of the pelicans and the fisherman testing their fishing skills.

The locks is a very tall iron bridge with good views either north or south as you are driving over. Careful it can be quite windy at the top. After the bridge take the first left and at the stop take a second left that will bring you to Red River Drive where you turn right. You are now driving on the west side of the Red River. On this side you will see Captain Corelli's house with a rest stop near by. Many years ago they were running a pleasant cafe at the back of the house. Unfortunately, it no longer exists. There is another rest stop further down then you will see the golf course before hitting the highway. Red River Drive will lead you back to highway 9, head south until you hit the perimeter.
