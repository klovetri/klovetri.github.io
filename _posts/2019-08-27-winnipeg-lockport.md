**April 19, 2018** 

After a day at work and the spring summer long days are here it is time for short, leisurely rides near home. This is just one of those rides. It is one of our favorites as we get to see both sides of the Red River. We go north on Henderson Highway to the town of Lockport where we have a bite at A&W, or Half Moon, Gaffer's to name just a few places. If you want it is a nice stop on the north side of the locks and you can view the pelicans and the fisherman testing their fishing skills.

Once you have had your stop with a bite or not you drive over the bridge. Careful it can be quite winding at the top. You can take Red River Drive back to the perimeter driving on the west side of the Red River. On this side you will see Captain Corelli's house with a rest stop near by. Many years ago they were running a pleasant cafe at the back of the house. Unfortunately it no longer exists. There is another rest stop further down then you will see the golf course before hitting the highway. Take highway 9 south to the perimeter and retrace your steps back.
