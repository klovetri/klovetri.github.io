**October 7, 2019**

It was 18 degrees C with a warm south west wind.

It is getting chiller to ride so I had leggings under my riding pants and my heat liner under my jacket to keep me cozy on the ride. I also like to wear my goggles at this temperature. 

Rode to Ste. Agathe taking Hwy 200 through St. Adolphe. Crossed Hwy 75 onto Hwy 305 which turned into a mud road and due to the recent heavy rains rresembled a pig pen more than a road. As I drove along it changed to parts with some hard packed and loose gravel.

The scenery was fields in which most of the farmers had been fortunate enough to have taken their crops off.

I hit a short piece of Hwy 330 which was paved then headed west again on the Hwy 305 which was again hard packed gravel with part of the road loose gravel. There was one large pig farm down this road but other than that it was just fields. I came to the town of Brunkild which was the destination I wanted to include in my ride. A friend who had passed away about 7 years ago was originally from this small town. I just wanted to ride by and think of her. She introduced me to cross stitch and was an amazing cross stitcher just to mention one of her talents.

At Brunkild I got on Hwy 3 heading back towards Winnipeg passing the town of Sanford then getting on the Perimeter Hwy East. Shortly after getting on there was some construction so it was down to 1 lane which increased the ride time by 25 minutes, unfortunately it wasn't a pleasant ride time (stop and go).

I saw a lot of other riders our there doing what I was doing, taking advantage of a beautiful riding day in October.
