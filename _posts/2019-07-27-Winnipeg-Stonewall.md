**July 27, 2019**

It was a 30 degree day with light winds.

I wore my jeans for this ride and my riding jacket with all my vents open.

We left from Pembina Highway and the South perimeter and traveled West on the perimeter and exited at Roblin Blvd. Turn left   onto Roblin Blvd. 


Once you are off the perimeter onto Roblin Blvd west (Hwy 241) which meanders south of the Assiniboine River. You will pass [Breezy Bend Country Club](https://www.breezybend.ca) with interesting places to stop like [Crampton’s Market](https://cramptonsmarket.com) and [Shelmerdine’s Garden Center](https://www.shelmerdine.com). This part of Hwy 241 is slightly busy until you pass the intersection of Hwy 334 (which will take you to the number 1 highway), but stay on Hwy 241. 



Continue on Hwy 241 through the small town of South Headingley, shortly after passing the town you will hit some hard packed (oiled to keep the dust down) gravel but the riding is not difficult. You will pass through Beaudry Provincial Park where you can enjoy a picnic area by the river and it has washrooms (unsure if this is all year around or only in the summer) and if you have time take a hike on the Headingley Grand Trunk Trail. 



Continue on Hwy 241 to the stop sign and turn right onto Lido Plage Road which gets you back onto pavement. This is a nice curvy drive. Turn right onto Hwy 424 then right onto the # 1 highway (heading east). 


In a matter of minutes you will be at the intersection to turn left onto Hwy 26  (White Horse Monument on your left) to bring you to the town of St. Francois Xavier. Continue west on Hwy 26 where you will be driving on the north side of the Assiniboine River. 

Your next right turn will be onto Hwy 248 which takes you to the town of Marquette, MB. There is a Co-op gas bar here if needed. Continue north on Hwy 248 and make a right turn onto Hwy 227 to the town of Warren, MB. You will be seeing a lot of grain and corn fields mixed in with large power lines. 


Just past the town of Warren you will turn left onto Hwy 67 to the town of Stonewall. Turn left onto 5th Street West to enter the town  and turn right at 2nd Ave N then left at Main Street this will take you into the parking lots of the [Stonewall Quarry Park](www.stonewallquarrypark.ca). They have an Interpretive Centre, trails, a manmade swimming area (called Kinsmen Lake) with lifeguards and a canteen for a drink and some food. We enjoyed cooling our feet in Kinsmen Lake and relaxing before our journey back home. Stonewall also has numerous restaurants and a Tim Hortons (corner of Hwys 236 and 67). 


Back on the bike and head back south on Main Street and turn left on 3rd Ave N then turn right onto Hwy 236. As you are heading down this road just out of Stonewall there is a great wall (about 2 km long) on your right of very very tall spruce trees (great fore thought by the tree planters many years ago). These trees provided some great shade as we were driving. The smell of a halfalfa field greated my nose as well as golden wheat field contrasted to the green corn field. Hwy 236 will bring you to Hwy 6 take a left then exit onto the perimeter hwy in the direction that will bring you back to your home.
