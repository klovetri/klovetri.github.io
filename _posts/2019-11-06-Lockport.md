**October 26, 2019**

Well this is definately the last ride on my motorcycle for 2019. I have posted previously on this destination with the map so I will not include that here.

This was a little more of a solomn ride for me since my riding buddy was out of the country the month of October. Lucky him he was in a much warmer spot than I. It is not that I dislike, am scared or overwhelmed by riding alone, it is just so much more fun for me to experience riding with my buddy to share our impressions and our likes and dislikes of a particular road, destination. A slight competition on who catches different sights, sounds, smells on our travels which the other may have missed.
