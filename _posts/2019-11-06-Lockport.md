Well this is definately the last ride on my motorcycle for 2019. I have posted previously on this destination with the map so I will not include that here.

This was a little more of a solomn ride for me since my riding buddy was out of the country the month of October. Lucky him he was in a much warmer spot than I. It is not that I dislike, am scared or overwhelmed by riding alone, it is just so much more fun for me to experience riding with my buddy to share our impressions and our likes and dislikes of a particular road or destination. A slight competition on who catches different sights, sounds, smells on our travels which the other may have missed.

This was the last ride but is not the last post, please check in as I plan to share rides from the 2018 riding season as well as introduce some new features on the website.

Take care and keep dreaming and planning new rides in 2020!!

I am trying to see if I can add a video to this post. Be patient sometimes these things work or not!
