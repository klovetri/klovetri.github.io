**August 2 - WINNIPEG, MB TO FARGO, ND (346 KM)**

This route is very very straight forward, Highway 75 South out of Winnipeg to the Manitoba-United States border (at Emerson), continue straight on I-29 through Grand Forks and then to Fargo.

When we left Winnipeg it was 31 degree C. 

I had my riding pants on (I wore very thin exercise crop pants under) with my flaps open as well as my riding jacket with all flaps open and a very light t-shirt. 
The only time that I got heated up was waiting at the Canada-United States border in Emerson. 
Fortunately, the wait was only about 10 minutes. 
We had a great riding day, sunny, clear, and no cross wind (yah whoo!!).
We made a quick gas and snack stop in Grand Forks and we saw a lot of cyclists either driving or hauling there bikes in the direction of [Sturgis](https://www.sturgismotorcyclerally.com/index.php?page=home), South Dakota as the yearly ritual had just begun.

**August 3rd - FARGO, ND TO ST. CLOUD, MN (417 KM)**

When we left Fargo it was 26 degree C. 

I had my riding pants on with my flaps open as well as my riding jacket with all flaps open and a very light t-shirt. 

We left Fargo and headed south on the I-94 in the direction to Minneapolis. 
Exited at Hwy 210 which is the last exit for Fergus Falls, MN to catch the [Otter trail ride](www.bestbikerides/Minnesota/ottertrail). 
We picked up the ride from Hwy 210 and turned down Hwy 33 then to Hwy 35 to get to Dalton. This section of Hwy 33 has lots of curves and beautiful hilly terrain with very little traffic.

**July 13, 2019**

It was about 26 degrees C. 

I rode with jeans and my riding jacket with my vents open with a t-shirt underneath.

On this ride we are both riding on my BMW F700 GS since my husbands bike the Aprilia Caponord is in need of a new chain 
and sprocket which needs to be changed before any further riding is done.

We are leaving from Pembina Hwy and the South perimeter at St. Norbert. 
The destination for this ride was the St. Malo hotel (we are not encouraging drinking and driving) but the reason I choose 
hotels is that many small towns will have a hotel that is open and offers tasty bites to eat and a wide variety of beverage 
selections.

Because we have adventure bikes we like to search out the road less traveled which usually means gravel in Manitoba.

St. Norbert is always a hopping destination on Saturdays with the St. Norbert Farmers Market this is a must for loads of 
locally grown produce, local meats, baked goods, specialty items such as vegan chocolates, artists showing their wares. It is 
a pleasure to be in with the crowds on Saturdays to grab some produce for later, enjoy a snack or lunch from the many vendors 
and so much more. If you are into being environmentally friendly bring your own reuseable bags and ride your pedal bike along 
the newly constructed bike path. Also they have a great water play park for the kids to cool off just north of the market and 
in front of the St. Norbert Community Center.

I diverge continue South through St. Norbert then take a left at Turnbull Drive on the left side is St. Norbert Provicial 
Heritage Park. Travel down Turnbull for 1.6 km then hang a left onto Courchaine Road, this takes you over the Red River 
locks and if you look south from the bridge you can see where the flood way starts. They have turn offs just North of the 
locks where you can venture down and enjoy the view or try some fishing. Courchaine Rd connects you to St. Mary’s Road (Hwy 200)
turn right and travel South for 29 km. When you just turn onto St. Mary’s Road you will come into 2 nice curvies and that will 
be the end of that for the rest of the ride. You will drive by A Maze in Corn, a great spot later in the season for some
family fun. You will pass thru the town of St. Adolphe which has the St. Adolphe drive in that is boasting a large number 
of gelato flavors (next ride we will have to try it). You will pass the turn off to Niverville then the turn off to Ste. Agathe. 
Just after the Ste. Agathe turn off the adventure starts since the ashphalt turns into gravel, for the most part you can 
find some tracks in the gravel that make this ride not to hair raising and the fact that the traffic is very low the chances 
of meeting vehicles is low. You will continue on the gravel for 3.8 km and then Hwy 200 makes a sharp left, follow this for 
30 km and turn left on Hwy 23, where you will be back on pavement and this road gives you an appreciation of how vast the 
fields are in this area and the crops and people who rely on the weather to ensure a future. You will make a right turn onto
highway 59 which leads you to St. Malo, take a right on the 281 then a left onto Rue St. Malo (the main street) and the St. Malo
Motor Hotel is the second building on your right. We stopped for a refreshment and had some friendly service and also noticed 
the place was really hopping with locals coming in for supper, sharing with friends and testing their luck at the VLT’s. 
They have karioke and $3.00 pilsner beers on Friday nite.

Our way back was a via highway 59 to St. Pierre-Jolys we took a left onto Joubert Road which changes to Rat River Road, the 
road is gravel sprayed with oil so for the most part was easy to ride on. The road follows the very merky colored Rat River 
to the town of Otterburne just under 9 km. Turn left onto RD 34N and you will see Providence University College & Theological
Seminary on your left. It looks like it is a growing place in the small town of Otterburne. Follow the RD 34N which takes a 
left onto Main Street of town followed by a right to continue on RD 34N but for some reason the sign said Rd 17E. Don’t feel 
bad if you go right to the end of Main Street with the grain elevator on your right and make a right turn to go over the tracks 
and see a dirt road. If you are up for more adventure let us know how that road turned out. For today we back tracked with the 
help of google maps to get on RD 17E. Out of all the gravel that we encountered today this was very thick and loose so our ride
certainly was the most nerve racking on this road for 11 km. This will take you back to Hwy 200 turn left and back track the 
same way you came. Once you cross over the floodway bridge you can continue up St. Mary’s Road to the perimeter and make your 
way home from there.

Of course the easy ride with no gravel is go South on Hwy 59 from Winnipeg to St. Malo and return via the same way, but that 
wouldn't be as much of an adventure.

Happy riding and let us know about the adventure rides you have done in Manitoba!! Until the next post.
