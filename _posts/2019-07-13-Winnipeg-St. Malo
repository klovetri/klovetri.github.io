It was about 26 degrees C.
I rode with jeans and my riding jacket with my vents open with a t-shirt underneath.

On this ride we are both riding on my BMW F700 GS since my husbands bike the Aprilia Caponord is in need of a new chain and sprocket which needs to be changed before any further riding is done.

We are leaving from Pembina Hwy and the South perimeter at St. Norbert. The destination for this ride was the St. Malo hotel
(we are not encouraging drinking and driving) but the reason I choose hotels is that many small towns will have a hotel that
is open and offers tasty bites to eat and a wide variety of beverage selections.

Because we have adventure bikes we like to search out the road less traveled which usually means gravel in Manitoba.

St. Norbert is always a hopping destination on Saturdays with the [St. Norbert Farmers Market](https://stnorbertfarmersmarket.ca/)
this is a must for loads of locally grown produce, local meats, baked goods, specialty items such as vegan chocolates, artists
showing their wares. It is a pleasure to be in with the crowds on Saturdays to grab some produce for later, enjoy a snack 
or lunch from the many vendors and so much more. If you are into being environmentally friendly bring your own reuseable bags
and ride your pedal bike along the newly constructed bike path. Also they have a great water play park for the kids to cool 
off just north of the market and infront of the [St. Norbert Community Center](https://www.stnorbertcc.ca/).  

I diverge continue South through St. Norbert then take a left at Turnbull Drive on the left side is [St. Norbert Provicial Heritage
Park](http://tourismeriel.com/en/what-to-do/festivals-events/st-norbert-provincial-heritage-park). Travel down Turnbull for 
1.6 km then hang a left onto Courchaine Road, this takes you over the Red River locks and if you look south from the bridge 
you can see where the flood way starts. They have turn offs just North of the locks where you can venture down and enjoy the 
view or try some fishing.
