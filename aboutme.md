### My history

I grew up on a farm and started driving vehicles in the fields when I was 10 years old. I couldn't wait to turn 16 so I could get my driver's license. Back many years ago if you wanted to buy a cheap vehicle to drive you purchased a motorcycle. My brother and I went halfers on a 1987 Kawasaki 305 LTD when I was 17. It was fantastic! I remember taking it out for an extended trip to visit my grandparents which was a three and a half hour drive north west of where I lived. I don't remember it being particularly uncomfortable but I do recall a number of acrobatics with various leg placements as I drove down the highway. I am sure I gave many a motorists a reason to look twice as they were moving up close to pass me.

One of the scariest times I had on this little bike was when I was driving down the #1 highway east from Winnipeg, there was a very strong cross wind and I remember going fast to pass a semi trailer, then of course when I just pulled ahead the cross wind pushed my bike almost into the ditch. Lesson well learnt and still to this day I have great respect for the wind!!

As it happens in life I met a great man who was full of adventure and afraid of nothing. I gave him a lesson or two on how to ride the little 305 and he was hooked. We bought out my brother and owned the little bike ourselves. Who (my brother) in hind site I can never remember him really riding. 

That great man became my great husband and the little bike served as cheap transport for his summer commutes to his job while I was home barefoot and pregnant for the first 4 years of our marriage. 

Unfortunately due to blatant stupidity and prior to reading Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance (who would of thought we would need to do anything to a motorcycle other than fill the tank with gas and go). Well that disrespect lead to the engine seizing and that was the end of the little Kawasaki 305.

Even though it was the end of the motorcycle about 5 years after its demise we were shocked to get a phone call tracking the license plate to us. Again young and ignorant who would of thought people steal license plates to commit crimes. 

After many years (15 or so) and 3 other living locations we moved back to Winnipeg. It was just after we moved that we welcomed a new motorcycle into our garage a 2000 Yamaha V-Star 1100. For the most part this was, my great husbands (yep, still) bike which he will have to create his own website to share his many adventures (about 100,000 km). I would drive it on occasion but was a passenger to "ride pillion" which is a great perch to make many an observation.

An aside - A pillion is a secondary pad, cushion or seat behind the main seat or saddle of a horse, motorcycle, bicycle or moped. A passenger in this seat is said to "ride pillion". The word is derived from the Scottish Gaelic for "little rug". Thank you Wikipedia.

In 2017, I wanted the challenge of being more than an observer on the pillion.
This is where the history stops and the posts begin.
