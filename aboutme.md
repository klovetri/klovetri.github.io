My name is Karen. I grew up on a farm and started driving vehicles in the fields when I was 10 years old. I couldn't wait to turn 16 so I could get my driver's license. Back many years ago if you wanted to buy a cheap vehicle to drive you purchased a motorcycle. My brother and I went halfers on a 400 Kawasaki when I was 17. It was fantastic.

I don't remember it being particularly uncomfortable but I do recall a number of acrobatics with various leg placements as I drove down the highway.

Lesson well learnt and still to this day I have great respect for the wind!!
Well as it happens in life I met a great man who was full of adventure and afraid of nothing. I gave him a lesson or two on how to ride the little 400 and he was hooked. We purchased the other half of the bike from my brother. Who in hind site now I can never remember him really riding. That great man became my great husband and his little bike served as cheap transport for his summer commutes to his job while I was home barefoot and pregnant for the first 4 years of our marriage. 
Unfortunately due to blatant stupidity and prior to reading Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance (who would of thought we would need to do anything to a motorcycle other than fill the tank with gas and go). Well that disrespect lead to a
